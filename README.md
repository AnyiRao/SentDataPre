# Data preprocessing for Sentence Classification
This is a full implementation of data preprocessing for a CNN and a b-LSTM. 

With this code you can reproduce almost all results presented on baselines and the results we present in our paper.

## Requirements
- Python (2.7)
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Pandas

Download Google's word embeddings binary file from [https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) extract it, and place it under `data/` folder  

For most dataset, it could be downloaded from [https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-conv-torch/tree/master/data](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-conv-torch/tree/master/data)
